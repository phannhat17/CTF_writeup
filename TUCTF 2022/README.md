There are three challenges I solved but the organizer does not public source code so it is difficult for me to present the solution.  
If the source code becomes public in the near future, I will write a writeup for these challenges as soon as possible:
- Tornado - Web
- Vertical Traversal - Web  
- Swapping Heads - Web
